{"name":"singlefilelinux","tagline":"","body":"### What's this?\r\nsinglefilelinux is easiest way to make Linux LiveUSB for UEFI-based PC.\r\nIt only requires to copy just one file to USB stick, no need re-format it.\r\n\r\n### How to use it?\r\nDownload bootx64.efi, copy it to \\EFI\\BOOT\\ directory on USB stick, then reboot your PC.\r\n![install singlefilelinux](http://s3.amazonaws.com/syuu1/singlefilelinux.gif)\r\n\r\nIf it doesn't boot, you may need to modify boot order settings on UEFI.\r\n\r\nIf you are familiar with UEFI Shell, it also very easy to launch from the shell.\r\nJust copy to any place of any EFI System Partition, you can rename it to any name (like gentoo.efi or something), then launch it like this:\r\n\r\n`Shell> fs0:`\r\n\r\n`fs0:\\> gentoo.efi`\r\n\r\n### Live image\r\n## Gentoo install disk\r\n* [bootx64.efi](https://sourceforge.net/projects/singlefilelinux/files/gentoo/bootx64.efi/download)\r\n\r\n### How does it work?\r\nIt is combination of EFI-stub kernel and embedded initramfs.\r\nWith EFI-stub, linux kernel can directly bootable from <Drive>:\\EFI\\BOOT\\BOOTX64.EFI.\r\nThis won't need any bootloader unlike traditional boot method on BIOS environment.\r\n\r\nOn Live-CD, initramfs tries to mount CD-ROM, locate squashfs image and mount it.\r\nOn this image we modified the sequence, it does not mount any block device, initramfs itself contains squashfs image.\r\nTherefore it does not need any block device, just works with one kernel binary.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
